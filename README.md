- [Map your events](#map-your-events)
- [Add resolver](#add-resolver)
- [Fire events](#fire-events)

## Install

### System Requirements

You need PHP >= 5.5.0 to use Buuum\Event but the latest stable version of PHP is recommended.

### Composer

Buuum is available on Packagist and can be installed using Composer:

```
composer require buuum/phevent
```

### Manually

You may use your own autoloader as long as it follows PSR-0 or PSR-4 standards. Just put src directory contents in your vendor directory.

## Map your events

```php

use Buuum\Event;

$event = Event::getInstance();

$event->loadListeners(include_once __DIR__ . '/listeners.php');
$event->setResolver(new EventResolver());

```

## listeners.php

```php
use Buuum\Event;

return function(Event $event){

    $event->addListener('email.send.confirm', function(string $event_name){
        return $event_name;
    });
    
    $event->addListener('email.send.susbscribe', function($param1, $param2, string $event_name){
        return $event_name;
    });
    
    $event->addListener('email.send.rememberme', [App\Example::class, 'sendremember']);
};
```

## Add resolver
```php
$event->setResolver(new EventResolver());
```

## EventResolver.php
```php
use Buuum\Event;
class EventResolver implements EventResolverInterface
{

    public function __construct()
    {
    }

    public function resolve($handler)
    {
        return $handler;
    }
}
```

## Fire events
```php

\\ Static method
Event::eventFire($event_name);
\\ Method
$event->fire($event_name);

\\Â Add params
Event::eventFire($event_name, $param1, $param2);
$event->fire($event_name, $param1, $param2);

```
